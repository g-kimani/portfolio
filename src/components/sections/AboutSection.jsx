            I have always had an interest in computers and started exploring
            programming early with tools like Scratch 2.0. My first experience
            with an actual language didn&apos;t come until a bit later in 2015
            using Visual Basic in my Computer Science class. All told I had no
            idea what I was doing but it still had me interested enough to do
            some personal research and thats when I found Python.

            Python is most likely the language I have the most experience with
            (alongside JavaScript) as it was the first I ever used. I have used
            it to build custom scripts that help with my daily workflow, I have
            also used librarbies like PyGame to design simple to more complex
            games and Tkinter to build interactive user interfaces.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since starting with python I have branched into multiple other
            languages and learnt an incomprable amout. And I&apos;m still
            learning ðŸ¤“
